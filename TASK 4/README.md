# Task 4

## Aim :

To understand the functionality of Flex Sensor and it's Integration with NodeMCU.

Documentation :

1. Learn everything possible about flex sensor.
2. Consider you have one nodemcu, two flex sensors and one led. Now,

Write a code in Arduino IDE to blink a led once if one flex sensor is bent. Blink it twice if second flex sensor is bent. Glow the led without any blink if both the flex sensors are bent. Let the led be off if none of the flex sensors are bent.
3. Prepare a documentation on usage of flex sensor and it's Integration with nodemcu.
4. Write your compiled code in the documentation as well.
