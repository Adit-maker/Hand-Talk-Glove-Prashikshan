# Hand-Talk-Glove-Prashikshan

# Task 5

## Aim -
To make a talking hand glove virtually
To understand what talking hand glove is and it's construction.

1. Browse anything you want and Learn about talking hand glove.
2. Learn about TTS (text to speech) converter, because we will require it in our project.
3. Make a documentation of it as you did previously.

Note -
1. Use circuit diagrams, codes and anything you want in your documentation to make it easily understandable
2. Your documentation must have
    I. Technical things used (along with explaination of each element)
    II. Softwares used (along with explainations of those)
    III. Non technical things used
    IV. Circuit diagram with explainations
    V. Construction of the talking hand glove
    VI. It's working
    VII. Codes you used
3. The order may vary but the above things should be present in your documentation. If you want to add something extra feel free to do that.
4. For the circuit if you can use any simulation software to show it's working write about it in your documentation and upload the file individually.
